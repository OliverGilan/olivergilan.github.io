<p>Greetings reader! A little bit about me: I&rsquo;m currently working as a software engineer and living in NYC. I&rsquo;m interested in the evolution of the cloud and its applications, the processes of exceptional individuals and orgs, and the effects of technology on the world.</p>
<br>
<p>This blog is a space for me to organize my thoughts, share my ideas & observations about different topics, and talk about my latest projects or things that excite me. Just as my knowledge is not final any opinion on this blog is not final and represents my understanding of the topic at the time of writing which may be different by the time you read it. If I write something you disagree with feel free to reach out to me by email, Twitter, or by writing a post of your own and sending me the link!</p>

<p>I work at <a href=https://www.getcensus.com>Census</a>. We are the first reverse ETL tool and our mission is enabling companies to use their data warehouse as a source of truth to power all of their operations. We are growing fast and looking for new talent to join us. Here&rsquo;s why you would enjoy working with us:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are still small so there&rsquo;s no end to the interesting work that needs to be done and the opportunity for you to have an impact.</li>
<li>Everyone who works here has a high IQ and even higher EQ. Being able to rely on your coworkers for support and trusting that they&rsquo;ll handle things competently is a phenomenal feeling.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s as little bureaucracy as one could expect and you&rsquo;ll be completely empowered to ship fast and improve our systems/product without roadblocks.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s highly motivating and fulfilling to have users declare their appreciation for code that you wrote and that happens just about every day here!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested I encourage you to apply to our <a href="https://getcensus.com/careers?utm_source=workwitholiver">open positions</a>.</p>
