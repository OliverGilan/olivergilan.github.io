I'm an engineer and founder living in San Francisco and building [Mesa](https://mesa.dev) to push the boundaries of software development just a little bit further.

I was born in the Lower East Side, in a loft, with two incredible parents, an older brother, and a younger sister. When I was a young boy I was into art and stories -- I was brimming with stories to tell and loved the idea of being a writer. Early on my parents moved us to a rural, quiet part of New Jersey to prioritize our schooling, which suited me great because I liked the calm of nature.

In middle school I built my first computer and taught myself how to program, falling in love with technology and the way it allowed me to create. The possibilities of software felt endless. I aspire to build something that lasts beyond me, that I can look upon with pride for having built it, something I can show my kids to inspire them. I believe software gives me the chance to build that.

I developed an autoimmune condition in Junior year of college that incapacitated me for nearly 2 years. Countless doctors and some self-experimentation later I got back on my feet. I'm still working to regain some of the weight and strength I lost.

After graduating I worked at Microsoft, co-founded [Antimetal](https://antimetal.com/) with Matthew Parkhurst, and spent time at a couple of startups. After regaining confidence in my physical health I moved to SF to give my ambitions another shot.
