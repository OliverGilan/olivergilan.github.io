I'm an engineer and founder living in San Franciscco and building [Mesa](https://mesa.dev) to push the boundaries of software development just a little bit further.

I was born in the Lower East Side, in a loft, with two incredible parents and an older brother. When I was a young boy I was into art and stories -- I was brimming with stories to tell and contemplated being an author when I grew up. Early on my parents moved us to a rural, quiet part of New Jersey to prioritize our schooling, which suited me great because I liked the calm of nature.

In middle school I built my first computer and taught myself how to program, falling in love with technology and the way it allowed me to create. The possibilities of software felt endless in it's possibilities. I aspire to build something that lasts beyond me, that I can look upon with pride for having built it, something I can show my kids to inspire them. I believe software gives me the chance to build that.

In my junior year of college, 6 months before Covid shutdown my school, I developed an autoimmune condition that incapacitated me for nearly 2 years. Countless doctors and some self-experimentation later I got back on my feet. I'm still working to regain some of the weight and strength I lost.

After graduating I worked at Microsoft before leaving and co-founding [Antimetal](https://antimetal.com/) with Matthew Parkhurst. It became apparent early on I hadn't recovered the strength I needed to operate as a founder so I stepped back after our fundraise and continued to focus on my health. A year later I was healthy and moved to SF to give my ambitions another shot.
