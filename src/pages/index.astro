      <strong class="font-semibold">Hello, this site is a public slice of my personal journal</strong> where
      I share what I'm interested in and what I've learned — usually about engineering,
      business, and life. A few of the problems I'm currently spending a lot of time
      thinking about are the ability (or lack thereof) to create great software at
      scale, creating artificial organs, and optimizing my personal health.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      My long-form writing is posted on my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> while my thoughts
      that aren't fleshed out enough for a full entry are posted as a <a href="/stream/">stream</a> of consciousness.
      I'm currently compiling a list of the <a href="/books/">100 books</a> that I would read over and over again
      and I maintain a <a href="/blogroll/">blogroll</a> of writings and websites I love to read.
