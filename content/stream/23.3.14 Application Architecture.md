Apps have 4 main layers:
1. the infra
2. the core
3. the platform
4. the interface

Infrastructure is all hardware and software necessary to run the app.
The Core is the main business logic.
The Platform wraps the Core and productizes it with features like auth, subscription tiers, auditability, etc.
The Interface is how the user interacts with the platform whether it's a GUI, CLI, API, etc.

Only the Core and to a lesser extent the Interface provide value but most of the time spent in enterprise software development is on the Infra and the Platform.
