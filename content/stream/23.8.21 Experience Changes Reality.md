When I watch a football game today I see a different game than what I watched when I was younger. Understanding formations, strategies, skillsets, and the nuances of the game at a deeper level means each snap and each second between plays contains more information than what I could previously see. Similarly when my friends watch Baseball they are seeing something I simply do not. What looks boring to me is rich with information and nuance to them. 

With all things in life your knowledge and experience shapes the way your perceive reality. Whether it's programming,
business, love, sports, music, etc. The more you know the more you can understand the nuances of an experience in a way that fundamentally changes it.
