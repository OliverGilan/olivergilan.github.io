Boris gave me some advice yesterday that boils down to: *judge junior employees by their attempt, judge senior employees by their results.* 

It's such an obvious philosophy in hindsight yet so easy to forget as a leader. People early in their career will make so many subtle mistakes and work through so many inefficiencies and what matters most is not necessarily the ultimate outcome --- if you're hinging something really important on the performance of a single junior employee then you have bigger problems --- but how that employee grows from it. On the other hand if you're an executive then you are supposed to be approaching mastery in your line of business. It's no longer an excuse to blame the tools you have or the unfortunate circumstances that arose because you should have the foresight to foresee and plan around those circumstances and you should have the versatility to succeed with a variety of resources at your disposal.
