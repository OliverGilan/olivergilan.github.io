It occasionally strikes me as absurd how much time I and other engineers spend on physically writing and managing lines of code. Fixing syntax errors, wrangling types, finding logic bugs, typing out boilerplate, etc. At the end of the day basically all programs are are just transformations on data and then combining these transformations with other systems that can provide, store, and transform data in other ways. It feels like for our industry to mature we need to get to a point where engineers spend the majority of their time focusing on systems and the characteristics of those systems rather than the minutiae of how those systems are actually implemented. 

This is also why no-code tools rarely deliver on their promise. They get rid of the process of writing code physically but then you're still stuck moving blocks or doing some code-writing equivalent and they haven't actually eased the burden of building and managing a complex application system as a whole.
