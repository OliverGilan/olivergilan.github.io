I have been taught repeatedly by the universe that life's most important questions always have simple answers. I must not confuse complexity with wisdom and I must not mistake simplicty for easiness. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the hardest to implement. Losing weight, finding love, being happy, being successful. We search hoping to find a new answer that is complex enough to solve our problem but knowing the solution doesn't ever solve the problem. We often have the answer and that answer is usually simple. 
The rest is just doing the work.
