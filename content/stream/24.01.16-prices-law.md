*Half of the work is done by the square root of the total number of people participating in the work.*

If you have a 100 employees, 10 of them are doing 50% of the work.
When a company grows, competence grows linearly and incompetence grows exponentially.
If you can prevent that exponential growth of incompetence even a little you will have a massive advantage as a company.
