In order to lead at scale, effective delegation of responsibility is necessary. It's not always clear why some leaders and organizations are more effective at delegation than others but one failure mode that is commonly seen is delegating responsibility without the corresponding authority. This is a common failure mode for governments. 

When responsibility is delegated without the authority required to execute on the actions required to fulfill the responsibility then the individual with delegated responsibility has no choice but to play politics. Instead of solving the problem they must amass soft power and rely on the channels with real authority to get things done. This amplifies the principle-agent problem and leads to more bureaucracy, more meetings, and lack of accountability. When projects fail the only option is to point fingers and blame others because the game is inherently political at that point.
