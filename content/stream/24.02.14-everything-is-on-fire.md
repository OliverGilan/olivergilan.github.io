I definitely have perfectionist tendencies in me but over the past ~6 years I've made conscious efforts to overcome those. The counterintuitive reality is that if you wish to build a successful startup or be a leader of any kind then perfectionism is not a great trait to have. The reason is that **everything is on fire all the time.** You need to be okay letting most things burn and putting out the fires that matter. As a perfectionist your instict will be to snuff out every fire that you come across but that will leave you chasing every spark as the rest of your house burns down. As a leader you must direct your efforts to the minority of most important fires and save your perfectionism for the systems you build that can fight the rest of them.
