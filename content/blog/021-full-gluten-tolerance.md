**Overview**: Summer of 2019 [I became violently ill]({{< ref "014-living-with-buggy-hardware" >}}) and only recovered after cutting out all [FODMAPs](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know#:~:text=FODMAP%20stands%20for%20fermentable%20oligosaccharides,digestive%20distress%20after%20eating%20them.) for a significant portion of time. Over time I successfully reintroduced most FODMAPs except for gluten. Even up to a year ago gluten would trigger an immediate and severe immune response which resulted in rashes, red skin, and bloating. Today after two years of cultivating my microbiome through diet and behavior I can now eat small amounts of gluten with less severe immune responses. The following protocol is designed to accelerate the last bit of recovery and get me back to full gluten tolerance. <br>
**Thesis:** Dysbiosis[^1] & disregulation of intestinal tight junctions[^2] lead to immunogenic gluten peptides[^3] crossing the intestinal lining and triggering an immune response. Altering intestinal microbiome composition and fixing tight junction functionality via the reduction of zonulin[^4] will restore gluten tolerance. <br>
**Timeline:** Mar 17 - Jun 29 (14 Weeks) <br>
**Goal:** Achieve full gluten tolerance. <br>

## Philosophy
Since I got sick most of the symptoms and recovery has been very much in line with what an autoimmune disease is. My family is at risk for a variety of autoimmune disorders and we have a history of psoriasis. It certainly *seems* like my immune system is being activated when I eat gluten and so it might make sense to take drugs designed for those sorts of problems. [Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-biologics-evaluation-and-research-cber/what-are-biologics-questions-and-answers) like Humira are a powerful tool for people with autoimmune problems like this. That being said I do not want to take that path because 
1) those drugs are expensive and it would be one more hassle to worry about if my health insurance changes.
2) those drugs have nasty side effects and don't travel super well due to refrigeration needs.

I was healthy my whole life without drugs and I see no fundamental reason why that cannot be my future. I believe the following: it felt like a switch was flipped when I originally became sick and if that's the case then that switch can be flipped back. 

This protocol is not designed for the rest of my life it's designed for right now. There are clearly people who drink alcohol and coffee and eat worse diets than me who can digest gluten just fine because the body is a resilient system. But the body is also a complex system of systems and in such complexity positive feedback loops can occur that prevent the return to homeostasis. I'm hoping this protocol can get my body back to a functioning state so that I can remain healthy even while living a less strict life.

I expect this protocol to adjust over the course of these 17 weeks and I won't have 100% adherence. I will track my progress and any changes to the protocol and make that data available on this blog at a later date. At the end of this time I will undergo a gluten challenge where I eat gluten normally for a full week and write up the results. The biggest constraint here is my bodyweight. When I became sick I very quickly lost 30lbs and I've regained 15 of those pounds over the past two years of recovery. I'd like to keep gaining weight but I suspect this protocol will make that difficult due to the reduction of red meat consumption as well as regular fasting. I will have to track my weight over these weeks to ensure I do not lose weight. I do believe if my gut heals then we could see my weight go up as I'll be inclined to eat more and absorb more of the nutrients in my food.

[^1]: [Dysbiosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838534/#:~:text=Dysbiosis%20is%20defined%20by%20an,bacterial%20distribution%20within%20the%20gut) is a broad term that means an imbalance in the composition of gut bacteria. The food you eat doesn't feed you it feeds the bacteria in your gut which break it down into components that your body absorbs along with byproducts called [metabolites](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/metabolite) which affect various systems in your body. The composition of your gut bacteria matters because different strains of bacteria feed on different foods and produce different metabolites. These metabolites can promote or suppress inflammation, regulate the intestinal lining of your gut, affect your mood, and change the way your body absorbs various nutrients. Different strains of bacteria also breakdown food into different components. As it relates to gluten, depending on how this complex protein is broken down can determine if it results in immunogenic molecules or not.
[^2]: Intestinal tight junctions are protein complexes in the intestinal skin that regulate the movement of molecules across the gut barrier. It is critical for nutrient absorption and controls the balance between tolerance and immunity to non-self antigens.

[^3]: Immunogenic gluten peptides are components of gluten that when isolated during digestion cause an immune response. These peptides are not always exposed during gluten digestion and thus its hypothesized that many gluten-related problems may be the result of incorrect gluten digestion.
[^4]: Zonulin is the only human protein discovered to date to directly modulate functionality of tight junctions. Zonulin overproduction has been shown as a biomarker of impaired gut barrier functionality and is a specific marker for many autoimmune diseases. Zonulin inhibitors like Larazotide acetate have been shown to significantly reduce autoimmune symptoms for patients with celiac disease. It can hypotehsized that the overproduction of zonulin leads to intestinal tight junction impairment and what's commonly known as leaky gut syndrome which leads to immune response. If this is the case then if I reduce serum zonulin levels I should see a reduction in immune reactions to gluten. The composition of the microbiome as well as stress *may* both lead to zonulin production which is why a big part of this protocol focuses on the reduction of baseline stress levels.

[^5]: There are other ways to measure stress such as a cortisol reading from a blood test but I am using these proxies instead because I can get somewhat reliable continuous monitoring of them from my garmin. Heartrate and HRV are also good proxies because they correlate strongly with your internal vagal tone. We know that stress causes dysfunction of the intestinal lining by stimulating production of zonulin. The key here is I'm trying to reduce baseline stress not peak stress. When I work out or run hard I will experience peak stress and in those times I actually have a very good stress response because I'm a fit individual. The real problem is all the other moments when I should be relaxed but my baseline level of stress is just a little too high causing this constant drip of zonulin and cortisol. To understand how to reduce baseline levels of stress you need to understand the nervous system, namely the autonomic and sympathetic parts of it. The sympathetic nervous system activates the fight or flight mode in humans while the autonomic nervous system balances it out and calms you down. Normally these two systems are in a tug of war with the autonomic system keeping you calm most of the time and your sympathetic nervous system giving you energy in acute moments when you need it. It's possible for the autonomic system to become weak and unable to effectively balance out the sympathetic system leading to higher levels of baseline stress and it's this sort of imbalance that can lead to a bad positive feedback loop: higher stress leads to improper digestion leads to less nutrition absorption leads to worse sleep leads to more stress. So my main strategy for reducing baseline stress levels is to boost the functionality of autonomic nervous system and the biggest component of that is the [Vagus nerve](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve). The vagus nerve is one of the key pathways in which the gut communicates with the brain and vice versa and there is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859128/) that various vagus nerve therapies can reduce inflammation. HRV is a [great proxy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996447/#:~:text=The%20link%20between%20vagus%20nerve,established%2C%20correlating%20with%20vagal%20tone.) for understanding the health of the vagus nerve.

[^8]: Vitamin B12 is highly correlated with HRV levels specifically when studied among stroke patients but this is unsurprising considering B12 is critical for nerve health. I believe that adequate B12 levels would correlate to a healthier vagus nerve which would lead to improved HRV. that being said my B12 levels are not low nowadays (I unfortunately don't have data from when I was sick for this metric) so I don't expect this to make a huge difference.

[^10]: I feel I do not need to even provide sources for these two. Breathwork has been shown to clinically reduce stress levels and Vitamin D is critical for reguating the immune system and stress levels. I prefer raw, organic, unfiltered sunlight beyond just Vitamin D supplementation and I live in an area of the world where I should be able to get 30 minutes of sunlight a day but in days where I can't I will supplement.
[^19]: FODMAPs are sugars that are absorbed poorly and ferment in the small intestine. Cutting out FODMAPs was originally how I began to recover and whenever I get a bad flare up it is a strategy that helps control it. I maintain a mostly low FODMAP diet today but with this protocol I want to be stricter there for the time being which mostly amounts to cutting out various sources of sugar. Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how carbohydrate foods affect blood glucose levels. High GI foods spike blood glucose and lead to crashes that result in a food coma. Low GI foods are absorbed by the body slowly and give more steady levels of energy over the course of a day. When your blood glucose spikes your body releases more insulin which causes a whole host of problems including diabetes. For me specifically, higher blood glucose can lead to inflammation and immune activation which is what we're trying to avoid.

[^20]: The presence of acid in the stomach slows down the conversion of carbohydrates into glucose which lowers the overall GI of a meal. This is one of the reasons fermented foods are so healthy. [Source](https://www.gisymbol.com/low-gi-explained/)
