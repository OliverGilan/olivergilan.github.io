Greetings reader! A little bit about me: I'm currently working as a software engineer and living in NYC. I'm interested in the evolution of the cloud and its applications, the processes of exceptional individuals and orgs, and the effects of technology on the world.

<br>

This blog is a space for me to organize my thoughts, share my ideas & observations about different topics, and talk about my latest projects or things that excite me. Just as my knowledge and wisdom is not final there's a good chance that any opinion on this blog represents my understanding of the topic at the time of writing which may be different by the time you read it. If I write something you disagree with feel free to write a post of your own and send it to me or better yet, just flame me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olvrgln)!
