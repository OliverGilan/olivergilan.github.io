**Hello, this site is a public slice of my personal journal** where I share what I'm interested in and what I've learned --- usually about engineering, business, and life. A few of the problems I'm currently spending a lot of time thinking about are the ability (or lack thereof) to create great software at scale, creating artificial organs, and deterministically controlling/programming the immune system.
