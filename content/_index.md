**Hello, this site is a public slice of my personal journal** where I share what I'm interested in and what I've learned --- usually about engineering, business, and life. A few of the problems I'm currently spending a lot of time thinking about are the ability (or lack thereof) to create great software at scale, creating artificial organs, and deterministically controlling/programming the immune system. 

<br>

My long-form writing is posted on my [blog]({{< ref "blog" >}}) while my thoughts that aren't fleshed out enough for a blog entry are posted as a [stream]({{< ref "stream" >}}) of consciousness.
I'm currently compiling a list of the [100 books]({{< ref "books" >}}) that I would read over and over again and I maintain a [blogroll]({{< ref "blogroll" >}}) of writings and websites I love to read.
